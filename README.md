# CrossyRoadGame

A game created on the turtle python package to mimic CrossyRoad. 

The user has a turtle and needs to avoid the cars by moving up and down to reach the end of the road. The level then goes up and this process repeats. If a collision is detected the game ends. This was a challenge incorporated in the 100 days of code course on Udemy and this is my solution.
